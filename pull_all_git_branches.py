Git Branch Puller and Error Handler Script
============================================

Description:
-------------
This script automates the process of fetching remote branches from a Git repository,
checking out each branch (without upstream tracking), and pulling the latest changes.
It is designed to work within a specified working directory (DEFAULT_CWD) and includes
error handling with a timeout for each Git command.

Features:
---------
- Fetches all remote branches.
- Checks out each branch from the remote repository.
- Verifies if the branch is behind its remote counterpart; if so, it attempts to pull updates.
- If a pull fails, logs the branch name and error to a log file (LOG_FILE).
- Prompts the user to retry or skip the pull if an error occurs.
- Uses a timeout (DEFAULT_TIMEOUT) for Git commands to avoid hanging indefinitely.

User Guide:
-----------
1. **Configuration:**
   - Set the `DEFAULT_CWD` variable to the path of your Git repository.
   - Adjust `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` (in seconds) if you need a longer or shorter timeout.

2. **Usage:**
   - Run the script from the command line:
     ```
     ./your_script_name.py
     ```
   - The script will automatically fetch all remote branches.
   - For each branch:
     - It will check out the branch.
     - It will check if the branch is behind its remote version. If not, it will skip pulling.
     - If updates are available, it will attempt to pull them.
     - In case of a pull error, the error is logged to `pull_errors.log` and you will be prompted:
       - **y**: Retry the pull.
       - **n**: Skip pulling for that branch.
       - Note: Reccomendation is to manually resolve any error and skip pulling 
       
3. **Error Logging:**
   - Any pull errors (including retry failures) are appended to the file specified by `LOG_FILE`.
   - Review this file later to see which branches encountered issues.

4. **Dependencies:**
   - Python 3.x is required.
   - Git must be installed and available in the systemâ€™s PATH.
   
5. **Note:**
   - This script does not set up upstream tracking on local branches.
   - Ensure you run the script in an environment where the repository exists at the specified `DEFAULT_CWD`.
